POC Spring Monolith with a Vue 3 SPA

## Why?

Another "dOn'T wOrRy AbOuT iT bRo", personal project.

Strengthening web architecture skills. I can work with spring java controllers and am solid in javascript.

This means:

- Pretty pictures and diagrams (me no write, me draw!).
- A design document (wowsers!).
- Cobbled together code (hurray!).
- Half awake dad humor (word.).

## What?

YAGNI'ing up a spring & vue SPA monolith proof of concept. Doesn't need to be pretty. Just need endpoints to get/post/put/delete to. Not doing server side rendering, SEO is irrelevant.

Might throw up some junk code and never return. 3 side-projects in-progress. Many discarded along the wayside. Few completed. Not sorry.

## Stack?

1. Vue 3 - Sometimes a light single page application is a fine thing to want to build
2. Pinia - for auth credentials and other things an app would want saved app-wide
3. Spring - Backend, vue's going to call all the things here
4. Typescript / Java - Languages for Vue and Spring
5. Mermaid diagrams!
6. css (we're going native)
